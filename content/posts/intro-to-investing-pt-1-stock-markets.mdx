As we covered in the previous article on [the 4% rule and your FIRE figure](https://twka.netlify.com/just-how-much-do-you-need-the-4-rule-and-your-fire-figure) to have enough saved up to retire on we need to exploit the stock market. With that in mind it's worth understanding, at least at a surface level how the stock market works and how we can use it to our advantage.

This article originally incorporated what is now [part 2](https://twka.netlify.com/intro-to-investing-pt-2-uk-investing-basics) which covers how we invest in the stock market using ISAs and platforms etc. but it was a little bit long. As we're covering, you know, what could basically be someone's entire career, it's been split into two for both of our sanity.

First up, the stock markets.

## Stock markets are terrifying
Common wisdom holds that stock markets are for reckless gamblers who can see their life savings disappear in the space of a day and is something best left to the Jordan Belforts and Warren Buffets of this world.

Much of this perception comes from trading individual stocks. As a fun aside stocks are just the US term for what we call shares; stocks are used to refer to the use of the stock market as something to be invested in and shares when talking about investing a particular company you have more of an interest in. 'I invest in the stock market' vs. 'I own shares in Barclays'.

## Understanding the attraction
Stocks and shares of a company are volatile. Their value is influenced by the latest quarter earnings, rumours of mergers with other companies, comings and goings of CEOs, world politics, regulation... You get the idea.

What makes people invest in stocks is this very volatility. An investor will take a view on the performance of a company and say 'you know what, I think the company has great products and given the changing landscape will increase in value'. They buy some shares in the company and hope that they sky rocket. And they do, it's not uncommon for large companies' value to move by 10s of percent in either direction.

The trouble with this is though is it's bloody difficult to get right. The chances of picking a company that is going to double your money or even remain steady is tough. 

Added to that you don't want to be invested in only a couple of companies you want the right allocation of companies to ensure you're not overly exposed in one sector such as tech or mining.

## So why do it at all?
Well, growth. Investing into the stock market means your money makes money for you. Rather than holding cash which is eaten away at by inflation, the value of companies will largely outpace inflation and return greater returns than a measly savings account.

Further, to realistically stand a chance of having enough money to retire we need all the assistance we can get and the stock market is the way to do it.

## Have you not heard of 2008?
Many of us first getting into stock markets are scarred by the banking sector collapse that took the stock market down with it.

But step back. The largest drop was 50% from the peaks of 2007. And whilst watching your money be worth less and less is not pretty, the market had recovered from this end-of-the-world event in just over 3 years and then went on to increase almost every year since.

Now this may sound like naivety but bear with me. The market is emotional, it's jumps up and down like a small dog but in general, and forever, it has gone up. Slowly and steadily upwards.

There is a wealth of information on this phenomena out there so we shan't reinvent the wheel but just remember, the super wealthy and most of our pension funds use the stock market for growing capital so all we're doing is playing the game with them.

## What if we could own ALL the companies
So we know company valuations are volatile but that the stock market as a whole goes up.

What if there was a way to not invest in only a handful of companies that require research and sometimes blind faith but you could track the movement of the world's major indices like the UK FTSE 100 or US S&P 500.

Taking the S&P 500 for example, this way you'd be invested in the 500 biggest US companies not caring how the individual member companies perform, just the overall performance of the economy. You'd be invested across a multitude of different sectors keeping you diversified.

Added to that you'd be invested in the world's strongest economy and home of almost all innovation. It's poetic that the financial crisis coincided with the launch of the iPhone that transformed the world as we know it and saw Apple become one of the world's most valuable companies. Plus given all the ups and downs we've discussed the annualised (average) returns equate to around 9%. Now that's worth considering.
