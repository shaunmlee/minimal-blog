Many of us strive to be more creative. Either to create new products or ideas or simply to solve issues we encounter day to day. Common advice suggests brainstorming, finding inspiration in existing works. But there's another way to increase your creativity by doing nothing at all. In fact, absolutely nothing.

Have you ever solved that problem that's been niggling you for days whilst in the shower? Or suddenly remembered the answer to something that's alluded you whilst cleaning the kitchen?

Our brains are not computers and they do not run solely on the task we assign them. They run a multitude of different threads at once and often make great connections on things we are not actively focusing on. This phenomenon is well known by all of us but is also exploitable in less intensive manners (that bedroom will have to stay messy a bit longer). 

## Stop

To see what I mean simply stop. Look away from this post, don't look at your phone, turn off the TV, stop writing, don't start a conversation to fill the void.

Just be.

For 10 minutes with nothing going on and sit and think.

This isn't meditation where the aim is to let thoughts come and go without reaction this is simply to let what appears in your mind appear, process it and move on. 

## What's acceptable

I always joked that I was jealous of smokers because they have a social norm which enables them to stand and do nothing without looking like the're crazy.To get out of the office, stop for 5 minutes and just watch the world go round. 

Without the cigarette in hand you look lost and confused but there's a power to being able to push pause for short periods in the day. This is not an encouragement to take up smoking (I hope that was needless to say).

## Could be doing something better?

If doing nothing feels like you're wasting your valuable free time when you could be doing something better just ask yourself: how much of what you do outside of working is mindless? Endlessly scrolling Instagram or Reddit? Binge watching episodes of the Office? Keeping Spotify playing endlessly to fill the silence? We have a lot of time, and not all of it well spent.

So I recommend you take 10 minutes today, either with a cup of tea/coffee and do nothing.

Just watch the world go by and reset your mind. You'll be surprised with its impact.
