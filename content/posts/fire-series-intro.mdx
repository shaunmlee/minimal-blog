Unless you've had your head under a rock for the past couple of years, you will probably have noticed the phrase FIRE being bandied about when talking about either a) personal finance, b) Millenials, or c) both.

The catchy acronym stands for Financial Independence Retire Early. It's gained huge popularity thanks to several prominent figures such as Mr Money Mustache and Millenial Revolution who retired in their 30s.

## What's it all about?
The premise is simple. You can retire decades earlier than current wisdom permits by following simple techniques to build enough wealth to live on.

Rather than retirement being something that is dozens of years away and not being able to take your private pension until 55 at the earliest (57 for most people reading this), FIRE gives you an incentive to put money aside to live life how you want. No minimum retirement age here.

In some ways it's much like a trust fund. In fact, exactly like a trust fund. You have money invested and then live off the interest. Unlike a trust fund however, you don't need to born wealthy or win the lottery.

Quite the opposite, by reducing your expenses and investing into low cost tracker funds (don't worry, this will all be covered later) you will have enough to withdraw a percentage each year to cover your expenses.

## Why you should be interested
The real beauty however lies not in the Retiring Early part which many of us imagine involves idly Homes Under the Hammer but in Financial Independence. Though if that's your gig, go wild.

In the FIRE sphere financial independence (FI) takes on a different meaning compared to everyday usage. It means having enough income from your investments that you don't need to work. This is slightly different to how most of us use it when we leave home to mean we don't rely on the Bank of Mum and Dad topping up our income.

Once you've reached FI level the money you make will cover your expenses so working will simply be optional. 

## Um, say more about not working
That would be pretty great, not *having* to work.

If you continued to work imagine the freedom of not caring if your company folded, your boss was a pain or you really didn't like the career path you'd set sail down.

Fancy a year off to soul search? Sure. Fancy never going into an office again and doing something that actually lights your imagination or seeing the world. Yep, go for it.

This is usually the reserve of the very wealthy or those living off a pension following 50 years' of work. But that's not how it has to be.

## The US slant
Most of the content currently on the topic is heavily US biased. There's a lot of talk about maxing your 401k(?), a Roth IRA(??) and investing in funds we don't have access to in the UK.

Whilst the principles are the same, it's not much use if you can't actually apply anything you've read.
