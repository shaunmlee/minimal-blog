In part 1 we covered the basics of what the stock markets are and how we would like to be able to track an index rather than pick individual companies.

This isn't taught in schools though it really is only school-level complicated i.e. not very.

## ISAs
We've all heard of an ISA or Individual Savings Account. 

This is what's referred to as a 'tax efficient wrapper'. Anything we hold within the ISA is free from income tax or capital gains tax. This can be cash as most of us are familiar with or it can be stocks and shares.

For example, we buy 100 shares of shares in Company XYZ for £1 per share. Company XYZ goes on to have a blinding year giving you a million pounds in dividends (income) and the value of each of those shares you bought for £1 each now being worth £100 per share (capital gains).

As we hold this in our ISA the taxman doesn't get a penny.

Say what you will about a Conservative government but the increase of ISA allowance over the past several years to its current figure of £20,000 per year means almost all of the money we invest is going to be tax-free.

## Platforms
Now to buy the shares of Company XYZ we need to go through a 'platform' such as Hargreaves Lansdown (not affiliated). These are the intermediaries who actually take your money and buy the shares in your name held in your ISA.

It's as simple as going to a platform, clicking 'Setup an ISA' and then purchasing your shares through this platform.

## How do I invest in an entire stock market?
Fortunately this is not a new idea. Rather than buying shares in every company on the index we instead buy into 'index tracker funds'.

As the name suggests they track the performance of an index (FTSE100, S&P 500 etc.) by owning all the companies that make up that index.

You simply buy into that fund and hey presto you now own all the companies in an index (Google, Apple, Goldman Sachs etc.).

## Low fees
If you're somewhat familiar with investing you may have heard the term 'fund' used before such as hedge fund.

These are run by a fund manager who has a view on the market and makes you a wonderful offer of 'let me use your money to invest. If I make money, I get a healthy cut. If we lose money, well, you knew your capital was at risk'. The amount they take from you is a percentage of your holdings in the funds such as 1%.

1%. Not bad, but that's each year regardless of performance. The fund may lose 10% but you still have to pay the fund manager for the privilege.

The beauty of index tracker funds is that not only do they tend to outperform managed funds, because they aren't being actively managed, they just buy and hold all the companies in the index, their fee is a lot, lot lower. Like 0.1% low.

So not only are you getting better performance you're also savings a tasty amount in fees. Nice.

## Which index fund to use
For my investments I've personally used [Vanguard's U.S. Equity Index Fund - Accumulation]([https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-us-equity-index-fund-accumulation-shares](https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-us-equity-index-fund-accumulation-shares)). It invests in the whole US stock market and holds (as of 31/12/19) 3,402 companies including those that make up the S&P 500.

The S&P 500 index tracker is actually what Warren Buffet recommended be done with his estate when he passes away due to performing better than almost all other managed funds.

I chose this All Equity fund over the [S&P 500 fund]([https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-s-and-p-500-ucits-etf-usd-distributing](https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-s-and-p-500-ucits-etf-usd-distributing)) as it's past performance (though not a guarantee of future performance) was better than that of the S&P 500. My hunch is this is largely due to exposure to smaller companies that have the potential for higher percentage growth. If they do well, great. If they don't then they make up such a small percentage of the holdings they don't have a great impact overall.

## Which platform?
Whilst first getting my feet wet in investing I invested into the [Vanguard U.S. Equity Index Fund - Accumulation](https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-us-equity-index-fund-accumulation-shares) fund though Hargreaves Lansdown.

They are UK based and allow £25 minimum monthly direct debit. You can invest directly through Vanguard but their minimum direct debit is £100 per month. However, there is apparently a trick where you simply lower your direct debit with Vanguard once set up which in the new tax year 2020/21 we shall report.
