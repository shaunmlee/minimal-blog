If the premise of FIRE of having enough money invested to live the rest of your life sounds fairly pie in the sky then let's put some numbers behind it.

We've already promised you don't need to win the lottery to be financially independent but just how much is necessary?

## Trinity Study
The entire idea of FIRE is based off the Trinity Study. 

This analysis of the historic stock market asked the simple question of how much can you safely withdraw from an investment portfolio and not be left with no money given the ups and downs of the stock market on a time horizon of dozens of years.

The take home message was that withdrawing 4% annually gave a very high chance (>85%) of not exhausting your portfolio over a period of 30 years.

The period considered was from the 1920s to the 1990s so included all the things we would worry about: a market crash, a world war, economic stagnation. Follow up works including the dot-com bubble and the 2008 Financial Crisis have also yielded the same results.

There are assumptions within this that are for another article such as the mix in your portfolio of stocks vs. bonds but for now let's take it as given so we can have  some perspective and start to get some numbers.

## An example
Now to achieve FIRE we'll need a pot large enough that withdrawing 4% per year from our investments will cover our yearly outgoings.

If our annual cost of living is £15,000 then divide that by 4%, or more conveniently multiply by 25x (1/0.04), to get our target FIRE figure: £375,000.

Adjust this for your situation to find your FIRE figure. If you have no idea how much your annual expenditure is or the figure comes out as something silly then hold tight as we'll cover how to tackle this [later in the series].

## How to reach that target
Our example of £375,000 is by no means a small figure. However it is much more reasonable than many of would initially imagine to not have to work again.

You may be asking yourself how it's possible to get this kind of many and still stay true to the retire *early* part of FIRE.

There are two simple ways to make this work: cut your expenditure and use the power of the stock market to make your money earn money itself.
