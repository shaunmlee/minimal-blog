If you're anything like me you like to have things in order. Personal finance is potentially one of the most prominent and powerful expressions of your ability to keep things under control and working for you rather than against you.

However, it can be overwhelming. There is seemingly no end to the number of things finance related you can tackle, investigate, fret over or compare. Focusing on the small wins such as saving on insurance is great, but it can be lost in the wider scheme of things.

Calculating and logging your net worth is a great tool in providing some perspective to financial affairs though something which is not widely known about and is unfamiliar outside of someone appearing in the news when the sums being considered are in the millions.

But logging only greatest figures (unfortunately positive and negative) and forgetting about the minutiae is a powerful way to see where you are in the financial landscape. 

## How to do it

The easiest way is with a trusty spreadsheet. In column A list each large item that composes your net worth, these include things like:
* Mortgage
* House value
* Credit cards
* Car loan
* Value of a car
* Savings
* Investments

In column B list their value. Positive for things that are yours such as savings and the value of your property, and negative for money owed such as credit cards and mortgage.

Sum the values in column B and you will get your net worth. If it ends up in red or black is fairly inconsequential when first beginning, the point is that you now know where you stand. If you were to sell everything off and clear all outstanding loans this is what you would have left.

## Perspective
There will likely be items on there which you may not have considered when assessing your financial health. When I first did this I realised almost all of my net worth was locked up in the house. While it felt like the mortgage was vast and insurmountable, the recent sales price of similar properties meant that there was a good margin between what I owed and what it was worth.

If there are things on there which make you squirm such as the size of a car loan versus the residual value of the car then this is still worth knowing. If you were planning on selling the car and still ending up with a balance on the loan it may make more sense to keep holding off selling until the loan is closer to the value left in the car so you end up nearer to even.

## Tracking
Taking the power of evaluating your net worth to the next level is to track it month-on-month.

At the end of each month, reevaluate your net worth by checking the current balance of all loans, seeing if there is a change in property values and record the current value of investments. Seeing the net worth figure grow and change each month is a fantastic way to remain motivated when putting money aside into investments rather than splurging on something which becomes only a cost.
