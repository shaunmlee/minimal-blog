Bird watching is one the most enjoyable and satisfying ways to enjoy the natural world and we're especially lucky in the UK where we have a myriad different habitats and seasonal visitors. Added to that the local common birds are interesting too! 

Getting started with bird watching is incredibly simple. In this short guide we'll introduce you to the essentials to have you spotting birds in no time.

## Equipment

We’ve only needed 2 things for successful bird-watching. One is an app which we discuss below, but the essential item is a good pair of binoculars (read good, not expensive!). Without binoculars, you won’t be able to clearly see the birds to identify them.

My boyfriend and I each have a pair of [10x42 Nocoex binoculars](https://www.amazon.co.uk/NOCOEX-Binoculars-Binocular-Watching-EX6118D/dp/B078H5B1CH/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3LYICRXD3AT2E&keywords=nocoex+10x42+binoculars&qid=1578240011&sprefix=nocoex+%2Caps%2C165&sr=8-5). We find these to be the optimal combination of:

* lightweight enough to take on long walks,
* providing strong enough magnification to allow us to see birds clearly, and
* large enough lenses to give a sharp, bright image.

We use them for stargazing as well which they’re also good for which we shall write about soon!

## Familiarisation

Next, you’ll need some idea of what you’re likely to see. 

Familiarising yourself with a handful of birds before you step outdoors will give you a great start in spotting them once you’re outside. The birds we see on almost every walk are:

* Wren
* Robin
* Great Tit
* Blackbird
* Blue Tit
* Long Tailed Tit

We see these birds in most habitats across the UK, so you can be fairly confident you’ll see at least a few of them. We regularly see many other birds too!

## Identification

To identify new species, our secret weapon is the _Birds of Britain Pocket Guide App_ ([App store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/birds-of-britain-pocket-guide/id419358365)) which has a ‘bird finder’ feature. We’ve been birdwatching for less than a year, and can now identify dozens of birds, mainly thanks to this app. 

The bird finder allows you to filter birds by inputting details that you will be able to provide if you’ve had a decent look through your binoculars. The main feature we use are:

* Type of bird e.g. bird of prey, waterfowl, perching-bird
* Size, relative to other common birds e.g. ‘small/medium’ is pigeon sized
* Main colour

Once you spotted a bird, observe it for as long as you can through your binoculars, then apply the filters and scroll through the pictures. Hopefully you’ll see your bird and identify it!

The app also allows you to record your sightings, so you can keep a log of the birds you’ve seen, including when, where, and any other notes you wish to make.

We shall provide more info on using the app in another post (coming soon!). 

## Getting started

The final step is getting out there! We find it’s very difficult to bird watch from inside, so just pull on your shoes, go for a walk, and keep your eyes open!
